#  General Comments : Number of Blade Rows must be specified. Init Method can only be inf for now. Blade Rows must point to inf files.
#  Interface Method : Either Neighbors or Fully Extend. Neighbors is to be used when the curve files specified in the inf files span the entire hub and shroud,
#                     meaning that they should be trimmed based off of the blade profile locations.
#                     Note that the order of the inf files in Neighbors mode defines the blade set order, and will be used to determine the adjacency relationship.
#                     Fully Extend is useful for cases where the hub and shroud curves span only exactly the blade row's mandated endwall sections.
