# Contributing 

Contributions from the community are welcome. It is important to note that while the PyTurboGrid
software package is maintained by Ansys and any new submissions will be reviewed thoroughly 
before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can support user questions and develop 
new features to make this software a useful tool for all users. As such, we welcome and encourage
any questions or submissions to this repository.

For contributing to this project, please refer to the [PyAnsys Developer's Guide].
