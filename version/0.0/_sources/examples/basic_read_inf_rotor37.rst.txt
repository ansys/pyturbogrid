Basic Mesh Generation
---------------------

This example demonstrates how to launch PyTurboGrid, load a blade model
by reading an inf file, and generate a mesh. The example also demonstrates how to
query mesh statistics for the mesh.

Find the examples folder based on the path to the TurboGrid executable found by the call below to ``get_turbogrid_exe_path``.
This ensures that the examples folder from the current TurboGrid installation is used.

Ensure the examples folder exists.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-55

Print out the mesh statistics in a format suitable for reading.
json serializer can print nested dictionary content with indentation and formatting.
